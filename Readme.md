## Real-World Example

RePlastix partners with a city to upcycle local plastics into park benches:

- **Collection:** Citizens schedule pickups via portal; field agents use mobile devices to scan and log waste.
- **Processing:** At recycling centers, plastic is sorted and entered into Salesforce systems.
- **Production:** Benches and play equipment are manufactured, each with full traceability.
- **Transparency:** Benches have QR codesâ€”scan for source info, contributors, and impact stats.
- **Result:** Jobs are created, landfill waste is reduced, and civic engagement improves.
